## Gabriel Louis

I'm from Washington, D.C., and a creative writing fellowship originally brought me to Madison. I don't have any particular tool that I'm most excited to use in this course, but I'm excited to build my skills and tech literacy. One of my favorite authors is Edward P. Jones, and his novel [The Known World](https://bookshop.org/books/the-known-world/9780060557553)is a book I really admire. It's vivid and devastating.
